    <h1>The easiest way to program microcontrollers</h1>
    <p>
      CircuitPython is a programming language designed to simplify experimenting
      and learning to code on low-cost microcontroller boards. It makes getting
      started easier than ever with no upfront desktop downloads needed. Once you
      get your board set up, open any text editor, and get started editing code.
      It's that simple.

    <h1>Learn Python with CircuitPython</h1>
    <p>
      <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> is the fastest growing programming language.
      It's taught in schools and universities. It's a high-level programming language which
      means it's designed to be easier to read, write and maintain. It supports modules and
      packages which means it's easy to reuse your code for other projects. It has
      a built in interpreter which means there are no extra steps, like compiling,
      to get your code to work. And of course, <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>
      is Open Source Software which means it's free for anyone to use, modify or improve upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      CircuitPython adds hardware support to the core Python language. If you
      already have Python knowledge, you can easily apply that to using
      CircuitPython. If you have no previous experience, it's really simple to
      get started! Learning CircuitPython is learning Python.

    <h1>Supported by your favorite microcontroller</h1>
    <p>
      CircuitPython is designed to run on microcontroller boards. A
      microcontroller board is a circuit board with a microcontroller chip that's
      essentially an itty-bitty all-in-one computer. CircuitPython is easy to
      use because all you need is that little board, a USB cable, and a computer
      with a USB connection.

    <h1>More reasons to use CircuitPython</h1>
    <div class="home-table">
      <div class="item">
        <h3>Quick and Easy</h3>
        <p>
          Create a file, edit your code, save the file, and it runs immediately.
          There is no compiling, no downloading and no uploading needed.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="item">
        <h3>Beginner Friendly</h3>
        <p>
          CircuitPython is designed with education in mind. It's easy to start
          learning how to code and you get immediate feedback from the board.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="item">
        <h3>Easy Code Updates</h3>
        <p>
          Since your code lives on the disk drive, you can edit it whenever you
          like, you can also keep multiple files around for easy experimentation.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="item">
        <h3>Serial Console + REPL</h3>
        <p>
          These allow for live feedback from your code and interactive programming.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="item">
        <h3>File Storage</h3>
        <p>
          The internal storage for CircuitPython makes it great for data-logging,
          playing audio clips, and otherwise interacting with files.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="item">
        <h3>Strong Hardware Support</h3>
        <p>
          There are many libraries and drivers for sensors, breakout boards
          and other external components.

    <h1>Just the beginning...</h1>
    <p>
      CircuitPython continues to evolve, and is constantly being updated. We
      welcome and encourage feedback from the community, and we incorporate this
      into how we are developing CircuitPython. That's the core of the open source
      concept. This makes CircuitPython better for you and everyone who uses it!

    <h1>Thanks</h1>
    <p>
      CircuitPython wouldn't exist without the awesome work of the <a href="https://micropython.org">Damien George and the MicroPython community</a>. They did the hard work to reimplement Python on microcontrollers and continue to push the boundaries of what is possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thank you to <a href="https://adafruit.com">Adafruit</a> for continuing to support
      CircuitPython's beginner-focused development.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly, thank you to the CircuitPython community members who have spent time testing, triaging, fixing and enhancing CircuitPython, it's libraries and it's documentation. Together we're all making something incredible.
