Feather from Adafruit, like its namesake it is thin, light, and lets you fly! Adafruit designed Feather to be an open standard for portable microcontroller cores.

This is the **Adafruit Feather HUZZAH ESP8266** - Adafruit's take on an 'all-in-one' ESP8266 WiFi development board with built in USB and battery charging. It is an ESP8266 WiFi module with all the extras.

At the Feather HUZZAH's heart is an ESP8266 WiFi microcontroller clocked at 80 MHz and at 3.3V logic. This microcontroller contains a Tensilica chip core as well as a full WiFi stack. You can program the microcontroller using CircuitPython 3.  **NOTE: CIRCUITPYTHON IS ONLY SUPPORTED.** Wired up is a high-quality SiLabs CP2104 USB-Serial chip that can upload code at a blistering 921600 baud for fast development time. It also has auto-reset so no noodling with pins and reset button pressings. The CP2104 has better driver support than the CH340 and can do very high speeds without stability issues.

To make it easy to use for portable projects, there is a connector for 3.7V Lithium polymer batteries and built in battery charging. You don't need a battery, it will run  from the micro USB connector. If you do have a battery, you can take it on the go, then plug in the USB to recharge. The Feather will automatically switch over to USB power when it is available.
