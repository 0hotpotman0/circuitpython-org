This compact and reliable NANO board is built around the NINA B306 module, based on Nordic nRF 52840 and containing a powerful Cortex M4F. Its architecture, fully compatible with Arduino IDE Online and Offline, has a 9 axis Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and a reduced power consumption compared to other same size boards.
This allows the design of wearable devices and movement sensing projects that need to communicate to other devices at a close range. Arduino NANO 33 BLE is also ideal for automation projects thanks to the multiprotocol BT 5.0 radio.
