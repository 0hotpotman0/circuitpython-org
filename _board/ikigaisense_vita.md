Ideally VitaPatch could be a disposable patch. It is an dedicated device to monitor vital signs of temperature, heart rate, SpO2 and blood pressure. It is also an integrated solution to monitor all these vital signs.

VitaPatch has to be small if not tiny so that it is convenient. It has to be cheap so that it could be available to more people. It will be open sourced so that anyone could hack and improve.

This is an ambitious endeavour and most likely a bumpy one. If you are intrigued, let's join the force to make it real.
