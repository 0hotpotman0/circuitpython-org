In the F401 series, the chip is the cheapest, even cheaper than some F1, and crushed F1 on the main frequency, and has a floating-point arithmetic module, the IO port contains all the basic functions. Therefore, it is possible to provide a learning platform with a very high cost performance for beginners. In practical applications, it is not because the computing power is insufficient, and the IO port is incomplete and hinders development.
