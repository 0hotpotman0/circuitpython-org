Introducing the microS2 (**Pre-Release**) - An ESP32-S2 based development board with the size of an esp12 module!

**Features & Specifications**
 - 32-bit 240 MHz single-core processor 
 - 16 MB SPI Flash
 - 8 MB extra PSRAM
 - 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi - 802.11b/g/n
 - High gain antenna
 - Low Quiescent Current 
 - Neopixel (IO33)
 - Blue led (IO21)
 - All pins exposed
 - USB micro-B
 - QWIIC/STEMMA connector
 - Small form factor

**Pre Release Hardware?**
The board design is final and it works great. But right now, the only way to develop on it is with an unfinished pre-beta IDF and there is no CircuitPython, MicroPython or Arduino support. So I canâ€™t really call this board final until I at-least have a feature complete IDF to test it against :)
