This is the Saola dev board with a WROVER ESP32-S2 module. The module includes 2MB PSRAM.

**NOTE:** This board does not have a USB connector for the native USB. Native USB is broken out on the header and therefore requires a non-standard USB connection such as [a breakout cable](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4448).
