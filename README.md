# CircuitPython organization site

**To add a new board to the site:**

1. Duplicate `template.md` to `_board/<board id>.md`.
2. Edit `_board/<board id>.md` according to the template's instructions.
3. Provide 3 images. An original high-quality image. A smaller image (300 px width),
and a larger image (700 px width) in each respective directory (assets/images/boards/{small large original})
and process them in something like https://squoosh.app/ to reduce file size. If
you only have one image, place it in the 'original' folder.
3. Create a pull request with the file changes.
