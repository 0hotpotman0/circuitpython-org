    <h1>CircuitPython Libraries</h1>
    <p>
      The CircuitPython Library Bundle contains all current libraries available for
      CircuitPython. They are designed for use with CircuitPython and may or may not
      work with MicroPython. The bundle options are explained below.
    <p>
      CircuitPython libraries are separate files designed to work with CircuitPython code.
      CircuitPython programs require a lot of information to run. CircuitPython is so simple
      to use because most of this information is processed in the background and stored in
      libraries. Some libraries are built into CircuitPython. Others are downloaded and
      stored on your CIRCUITPY drive in a folder called lib.
    </p>
    <p>
      The full list of all the CircuitPython libraries contained in the following bundles
      can be found on the
      <a href="https://circuitpython.readthedocs.io/projects/bundle/en/latest/drivers.html" title="">libraries page</a>.
    <h2>Download and Installation Instructions</h2>
    <p>
      The libraries in each release are compiled to .mpy for all recent major versions
      of CircuitPython. Please download the bundle that matches the major version
      of your CircuitPython. For example, if you are running 4.0.0 you should
      download the 4.x bundle. The .mpy files are designed to take up less space on
      your CIRCUITPY drive. Unless you have a specific reason, choose the appropiate
      .mpy library bundle!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>To install</b>, download the appropriate bundle for your version of CircuitPython.
      Unzip the file, open the resulting folder and find the lib folder. Open the lib
      folder and find the library files you need to load. Create a lib folder on your
      CIRCUITPY drive. Copy the individual library files you need to the lib folder
      on your CIRCUITPY drive.
    </p>

        <p>
          This bundle is the uncompiled source code for every library. This bundle is
          not intended for general use! This bundle is only recommended if you need to
          edit a library file. This bundle works with all versions of CircuitPython.
        </p>

      <div id="adafruit-circuitpython-bundle-examples">
        <h3>Bundle Examples</h3>
        <p>
          Every CircuitPython library has examples to go along with it. This bundle
          contains every library example. This bundle will have examples that
          require the latest version of CircuitPython, and therefore contains files
          that may not work with all versions.
