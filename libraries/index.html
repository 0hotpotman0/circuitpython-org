    <h1>CircuitPython Libraries</h1>
    <p>
      These are libraries and drivers available in separate GitHub repos.
      They are designed for use with CircuitPython and may or may not work with MicroPython.
    </p>
    <p>
      The full list of all the libraries contained in the following bundles
      can be found on our
      <a href="https://circuitpython.readthedocs.io/projects/bundle/en/latest/drivers.html">libraries page</a>
      on Read the Docs.
    <h2>Download Instructions</h2>
    <p>
      The libraries in each release are compiled for all recent major versions
      of CircuitPython. Please download the one that matches the major version
      of your CircuitPython. For example, if you are running 3.0.0 you should
      download the 3.x bundle.
    </p>
    <p>
      To install, simply download the matching zip file, unzip it, and copy
      the lib folder onto your CIRCUITPY drive. Non-express boards such as the
      Trinket M0, Gemma M0 and Feather M0 Basic will need to selectively copy
      files over.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can always find the <a href="https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases/latest">latest releases of the libraries bundle</a>
      on GitHub.
